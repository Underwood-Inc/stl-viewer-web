# STL Viewer

This project leverages claude-3.5-sonnet artificial intelligence for development. It will provide a client that allows uploading an Standard Tessellation Language (STL) files (used in three dimensional modeling/printing) and render them in a virtual client-side object viewer.

## Stack

This project leverages Astro due to its lightweight nature and suspected experimentation with content management (that Astro was designed for) while leveraging the STL viewer as needed.

## Tasks

### Beta

- [x] basic STL viewer
- [ ] STL uploader

### Alpha

- [ ] create executable. is electron still relevant?

### TBD
